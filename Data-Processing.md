# Snowflake Data Processing

Getting business value from an organization's data requires the ability to:
- [Load Data](./data-processing/loading-data/LoadingData.md)

  Data has several forms:
  - Rectangular
  - Semi-Structured

  Snowflake can easily ingest data in both tabular and semi-structured formats without the need to pre-process the data for ingestion.  Snowflake natively supports the following semi-structured formats:
  - JSON
  - XML
  - Avro
  - Parquet
  - ORC
- [Extrude Data](./data-processing/loading-data/ExtrudingData.md)
- [Query Data](./data-processing/query-data/Query.md)
- [Share Data](./data-processing/sharing-data/SharingData.md)
- [Clone|BAR](./data-processing/sharing-data/Clone-BAR.md)
