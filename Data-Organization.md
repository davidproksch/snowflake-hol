# Snowflake Data Organization

Snowflake organizes data into a heirarchy of artifcats.  If you are famiiar with heritage RDBMS platforms, these concepts will be familiar.  The **DATABASE** object is at the top level.  A database contains one or more **SCHEMAS**. With in a schema, **TABLES**, **VIEWS**, **FILE FORMATS**, **STAGES**, and **SEQUENCES** are contained.  

In order to create these artifacts, navigate to the Databases icon in the Snowflake UI.  [alt-text](./images/Database-Tab.png)
